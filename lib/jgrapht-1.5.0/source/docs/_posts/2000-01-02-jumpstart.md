## Maven

JGraphT releases are published to the **Maven Central Repository**, so you can
easily add us as a dependency to your project:

<pre><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.jgrapht&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;jgrapht-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;1.4.0&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

(There are also [instructions](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht#using-via-maven) for how to use the latest **SNAPSHOT** build instead.)

## Development Environment

First, find out how to set up [your favorite IDE (or the command line)](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/wiki/Users:-How-to-use-JGraphT-as-a-dependency-in-your-projects) to work with JGraphT.

<br>

## Hello JGraphT

Next, try compiling and running the [hello world](guide/HelloJGraphT) example.

Once you get that working, dig into the [user guide](guide/UserOverview) to learn more about JGraphT!
